-- test propositional logic and greater than  with initialized boolean and int variable declaration with constant value(with error)
int i = 5
int j = 1
int m = 35
boolean p = true
boolean q = false
boolean m = true
verify p <=> q and i > j or not m > 0
boolean r = true
int q = 8
boolean s = false
verify not r and (s or q) <=> p => m > i * j and not i > m
boolean s1 = true
boolean r0 = false
int s1 = 0
boolean k = false
verify not r0 <=> (s1 => (not k and r)) or i > j - m
