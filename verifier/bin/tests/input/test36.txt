-- test conjunction with initialized boolean variable declaration with relational value + propositional value (with error)
int i = 1 + 3
int j = i * 2
int m = 3 * 4 + 5
boolean p = not i > 0
boolean q = i > j and k
verify p and q
boolean r = j >= m and p
boolean s = j < 20 or m = 17
boolean s = i = j
verify not r and s and p
boolean s1 = j = i => s
boolean r0 = i = j <=> s1
boolean k = m < i and not r
verify not r0 and s1 and not k and r
