-- test of propositional logic with initialized boolean variable declaration with constant value (with error)
boolean p = true
boolean q = false
boolean k = true
verify not p => (q and p)
boolean k = false
verify k <=> (not q and p => not p and q)
boolean s = false
verify not (s <=> p or q)
boolean r = true
boolean s = true
verify (r => q) or (not p <=> (k and s))
