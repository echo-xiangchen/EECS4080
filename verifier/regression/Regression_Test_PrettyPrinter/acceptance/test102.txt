-- test propositional logic with initialized boolean variable declaration with propositional value (with error)
boolean p = true
boolean q = not p or p
verify q and not p => not q
boolean p = not q
boolean r = p and q
boolean t1 = p or q
verify r and t1 <=> not p or q
verify t1 => (not r and (p and q))
boolean t2 = t1 => p
boolean t3 = p <=> t2
boolean t3 = q => r and t1
verify t3 and t2 => not (t1 or (r => q))
