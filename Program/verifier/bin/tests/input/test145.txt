int i = 5
int j = 1
int m = 35
boolean p = true
boolean q = false
verify p <=> q and i >= j or not m = 0 and not q => i <= j or j > m + i
boolean r = true
boolean s = false
verify not r and (s or q and i + j = m) <=> p => m = i * j and not i >= m * j
boolean s1 = true
boolean r0 = false
int n
boolean k = false
verify not r0 and (s1 => (not k <=> r)) or i < j - m * 5 and m = 35 or k and n <= m + i + j
