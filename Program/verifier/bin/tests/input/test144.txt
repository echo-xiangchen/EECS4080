int i
int j
int m
boolean p
boolean q
boolean k
verify not p and q => i > j * m <=> k or n = i - j and not (j / m >= 120)
boolean r 
boolean s
int p
verify not r and (s or q) <=> p => m = i * j and r <=> m < i or not k => i <= j
boolean s1
boolean j
boolean r0
int n
boolean l
verify not r0 <=> (s1 => (not l and n < m + i * j)) or i = j - m => n >= m - i
