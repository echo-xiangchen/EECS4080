## Due: August 12

1. Read more on Antlr book    
    Exercises:     
        a. Implement operations on the small expression language    
            - Pretty Print (infix and postfix    
            - Type Check     

2. Try Proposition theorems in Z3    
    - See the Gries-Theorems.pdf under resources    
    - If time permitted, also see how you can encode the predicate theorems in Z3.    
    - Resource: https://rise4fun.com/z3/tutorial

3. Develop a simple Java program which:    
    - Takes as input a text file in SMT-Lib format (functional style)    
    - Output to the console: Outputs from Z3 verbatim (e.g., unsat vs. sat with witnesses)    
    - Explore if there are different output options of Z3 (e.g., format, witnesses)    
        note. Your compiler later will transform these outputs to more user-friendly format      

4. Find papers on "automated predicate solver" in the context of "computing education"    
    - Research Question: How can the automated logic verifier you build facilitate the learning of students (e.g., 1090, 3311)?    
    - Potential keywords:    
        - Computing/Engineering Education
