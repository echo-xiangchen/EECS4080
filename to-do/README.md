1. Read more on Antlr book    
    Exercises:     
        a. Implement operations on the small expression language    
            - Pretty Print (infix and postfix    
            - Type Check     

2. Try Proposition theorems in Z3    
    - See the Gries-Theorems.pdf under resources    
    - If time permitted, also see how you can encode the predicate theorems in Z3.

3. Develop a simple Java program which:    
    - Takes as input a text file in SMT-Lib format (functional style)    
    - Output to the console: Outputs from Z3 verbatim (e.g., unsat vs. sat with witnesses)    
    - Explore if there are different output options of Z3 (e.g., format, witnesses)    
        note. Your compiler later will transform these outputs to more user-friendly format
