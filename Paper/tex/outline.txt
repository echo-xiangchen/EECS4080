- Background
	* Design by Contract
		+ pre and post conditions
	* weakest precondition
		+ assignments, conditionals, seq. comp.
	* Program Verification using Hoare Triples
		+ {Q} S {R}
		+ loops
	* Z3: p -> not p -> Z3 -> sat (counterexample) or unsat (tautology)
	* ANTLR4
- Examples of Features (examples.tex)
	* Proposition and predicates
	* if-statements (compute tax)
	* Arrays, Pairs
	*** old expressions
	* Queries
	* Commands
	* loops 
- Design
	* Grammar
	* Classes
	* Composite Design Pattern
	* Visitor Design Pattern

- Implementation of Transformations (implementation.tex)
	* input-to-ANTLR
	* ANTLR-to-Model
	* Model-to-Model
	* Model-to-Z3
- Challenges
	* Arrays and type checking
	* old values 
	* wp calculations
- Practical Implication (practical-implication.tex)
	* Teaching logic in absense of an instructor
		-> facilitates online teaching
- Future work
	* Adopt this tool in EECS3311 F20
	* Design an experiment to evaluate the tool
