-- test conjunction 
-- with initialized boolean variable declaration with relational value (with error)
int i = 1 + 3
int j = i * 2
int m = 3 * 4 + 5
boolean p = i > 0
boolean q = j >= i
boolean q = s <= 0
verify p and q
boolean r = j >= m
boolean s = j < 20
boolean r = m > i * j
verify p and q and r and not s
