int i = 5 * 6 - 9
int j = 1 + 9
int m = 35 - 12 * 2
boolean p = true
boolean j = false
boolean q = not p
verify p <=> q and (i < j or not m < 0)
int q = i + j
boolean r = not p => q and p
boolean s = r and p <=> q and p
verify not r and (s or q) <=> (p => m < i * j) and not i < m
boolean s1 = i < j - 3
boolean r0 = m = i * (j + 5)
int s = m + i * j
boolean k = i < m - 7
verify not r0 <=> (s1 => (not k and r)) or i < j - m
