int i = 5 * 6 - 9
int j = 1 + 9
int m = 35 - 12 * 2
boolean p = true
boolean j = p => not p
boolean q = not p
verify p <=> q and (i >= j or not m >= 0)
boolean r = not p => q and p
boolean s = r and p <=> q and p
int q = 5 + 4 * 2
verify not r and (s or q) <=> (p => m >= i * j) and not i >= m
boolean s1 = i >= j - 3
boolean r0 = m = i * (j + 5)
boolean k = i >= m - 7
verify not r0 <=> (s1 => (not k and r)) or i >= j - m
